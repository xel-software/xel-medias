[size=13pt][b]What is Elastic?[/b][/size]\
\
[size=11pt]Elastic is an open-source project that aims to build the first decentralized supercomputer. Elastic has been developed over the last year or so and provides the infrastructure for a decentralized and distributed super computer, designed to carry out arbitrary tasks over the internet. In  this  context,  Elastic is  powered by a crypto currency (XEL) and provides a market-based mechanism to buy  and  sell computational  resources. Those  who need  computational  resources,  model  their  problem using Elastic\'92s programming language (Elastic PL) and broadcast it on the network, along with a certain amount of XEL coins. The Elastic miners are then motivated to offer their computational resources in exchange for a portion of those XEL coins. The size of their reward depends on the amount of work a miner has contributed in relation to the rest of the miners that have also participated in the task. Using XEL as the driving force, Elastic offers potential buyers a large parallel computation cluster composed of many CPUs and GPUs supplied by the miners.\

[size=11pt]\
\
Q: Why are there no recent updates in the Github?\
\
A: Because of the decentralized way of development and community driven organization of Elastic it can be hard sometimes to find the most recent Github where the actual work is being done, as Githubs change and different branches are being merged etc. To find the latest Github just ask in the thread or try https://github.com/elastic-coin/DevelopmentURLs which tries to stay up to date when it comes to all the different Githubs.\
